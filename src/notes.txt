Note: I had written these notes during development process, so they are not directly useful to anyone. Just keeping it over here if someone is actually forking this repository, these small notes might surely help.

1. select the roi first
2. capture the image only when a key is pressed on the keyboard.
3. select the keyPress thresh (optional)
4. save the image then save the key pressed with its image name in .csv file (dataset.csv)

Lane_detection:
1. select the roi (remove unnecessary edges)
2. Hough transformation 
3. then blur the image to smoothe its edges( gaussian i guess)
4. car detection in front using maskrcnn (Try - not sure of this) ----> (no ..try using yolo...its much faster than maskrcnn) (Useless)
5. lane detection : (try tf object detection api) --> (i was wrong ... need to use opencv only) (Useless)

Note: the preprocessing stated earlier is not used

Preporcessing(Later):
  1. down half edge highlighter
  2. crop the upper less than half part

Catagories for multi-class classification
  1. forward - w
  2. backword - s
  3. left - a
  4. right - d
  5. forward_right - w,d
  6. forward_left - w,a
  7. backward_right - s,d
  8. backward_left - s,a
(Now create a mapping for this in the csv file)

For all the images now in one folder, save all the images in these 8 folders.

To run gta sa in small mode use the package d3d9.dll and save it in the installtion folder
