1. select the roi first
2. capture the image only when a key is pressed on the keyboard.
3. select the keyPress thresh (optional)
4. save the image then save the key pressed with its image name in .csv file (dataset.csv)

Preprocessing:
1. select the roi (remove unnecessary edges)
2. Hough transformation 
3. then blur the image to smoothe its edges( gaussian i guess)
4. car detection in front using maskrcnn (Try - not sure of this) ----> (no ..try using yolo...its much faster than maskrcnn)
5. lane detection : (try tf object detection api) --> (i was wrong ... need to use opencv only)
